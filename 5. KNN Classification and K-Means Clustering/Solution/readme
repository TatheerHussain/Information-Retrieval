Code File: KNN1.ipynb, KNN2_KMeans.ipynb 
Analysis File: Report.pdf
Rest data files and readme.

There are 2 methods I did for KNN.

P.S. extra_data folder contains the intermediate files used to generate the final data files.

To run the program, keep all the files in the same folder and open Jupyter Notebook to run the program stepwise, else create a python file out of it.

P.S. Install all the dependencies mentioned in the python notebook.
